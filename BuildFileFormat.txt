The build.json File Format is a JSON encoded configuration file for managing JS & CSS 
project builds.

The top-level keys are:
- projectName:  String describing the project
- licenseText:  String specifying the header of all .js and .css, use \n for
                newlines.
- pkgs:         An array of `Package Descriptors`


Package Descriptors:
- name:         String describing the package 
- filename:     String specifying the file name to create. Can be a full path
                from the output directory specified on the command line.
                Ex: "build.js"
- includes:     An array of `Include Directives` which need to be included in this
                package.


Include Directives. Can be one of 3 types:

1) File include. Keys:
- file:         A relative path to a particular file that should be included.

2) Directory include, which is a single, non-recursed directory. (For a recursed
directory, use Tree). Keys:
- directory     A relative path to a directory of files that should be included.
                The file extension of the files that are included from the directory 
                will match the package's file extension.

3) Tree include, which is a directory, and all of its subdirectories. Keys:
- tree:         A relative path to a directory of files which itself, and all of its
                subdirectories should be included. The file extension of the files 
                that are included will match the package's file extension.
